##Why...

Don't you just hate all the free sites with so much advertising? Yes, I do too. So, although there is probably hundredes of sites that
allow you to track your collection, this one will never have advertising. The interface always be crisp and clean.

I wanted a card management website that captures something of the experience of sitting in front of my box of cards and laying them
out and comparing them. I hope this site site will do the same for you.
